# **{find+}**
**{find+}** is a simple find in page Google Chrome extension with support for regular expressions. It is designed to resemble the familiar `CTRL-F` function, but allowing you to search for very specific keywords in large documents and web pages.

## Motivation
As a software developer, looking through lengthy stack traces, continuous integration build history, or large text files is something you do very regularly. The Chrome _Find in Page_ tool works well in most cases, but offers very little when looking for very specific (or very general) keywords.

This extension has become a growing project aimed at giving developers better tools to simplify certain redundant tasks and to improve upon the functionally limited tools currently available.

## Getting Started
The **{find+}** chrome extension is still in version alpha, and thus not available through the Chrome Store. However, you can install the extension by using Developer Mode under the Chrome extension settings. These steps will help you get started.

To begin, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by clicking the green `Clone or Download` button in GitHub. If you are comfortable using git, you can copy the HTTPS clone link to your clipboard and clone the repository to a location on your local machine by running the following command in the terminal:

```
cd <directory you want to clone to>
git clone <clone link from clipboard>
```
<sup>Note: If you are using a Windows machine, you may need to install git [here](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).</sup>

Otherwise, you can click `Download ZIP` and extract the source files to a location on your computer.

To install the extension in Chrome, navigate to the Settings page in Chrome and click `Extensions` on the left. Enabling Developer Mode will show a button to `Load Unpacked Extension`, which you can use to navigate to the parent folder of the extension. Yay! You installed the extension!

## A Small Notice
Since **{find+}** is still in version alpha, you will likely experience bugs or issues while using the extension. We are hard at work fixing these issues, but we encourage you to continue using our extension in the meantime. You can keep an eye on current issues in progress by monitoring our GitHub page.
